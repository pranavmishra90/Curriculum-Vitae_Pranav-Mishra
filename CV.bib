	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{COV}-2), previously known as 2019-{nCoV}, is responsible for the atypical pneumonia pandemic designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019 ({COVID}-19). The number of cases continues to grow exponentially reaching 492,000 people in 175 countries as of March 25, 2020. 22,169 people (∼4.5\%) infected with {SARS}-{COV}-2 virus have died. We have developed an exponential regression model using the {COVID}-19 case data (Jan 22 – Mar 22, 2020). Our primary model uses designated Phase 1 countries, who exceed 2500 cases on Mar 22. The model is then applied to Phase 2 countries: those that escaped the initial Phase 1 global expansion of {COVID}-19. With the exception of stabilizing countries (South Korea, Japan, and Iran) all Phase 1 countries are growing exponentially, as per I2500(t) = 120.4 × e0.238t, with a rate, r = 0.238 ± 0.068. Excluding China, the {BRICS} developing nations and Australia are in Phase 2. Case data from Phase 2 countries are following the model derived from Phase 1 countries. In the absence of measures employed to flatten the curve including social distancing, quarantine, and healthcare expansion, our model projects over 274,000 cases and 12,300 deaths in the {US} by Mar 31. India can expect 123,000 cases by April 16. By flattening the curve to the growth rate of stabilizing countries (r = 0.044 ± 0.062), the {US} would prevent 8,500 deaths by Mar 31, and India would prevent 5,500 deaths by April 16.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.Funding {StatementNo} funding was received or required for this {studyAuthor} {DeclarationsAll} relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary {IRB} and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the {IRB}/oversight body are included in the manuscript.{YesAll} necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.{YesI} understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an {ICMJE}-approved registry, such as {ClinicalTrials}.gov.

	shorttitle = {Induction of ventricular fibrillation},
	abstract = {Ventricular fibrillation is a form of cardiac arrhythmia, or abnormal electrical activity, localized in the bottom to chambers of the heart, causing the muscle to quiver and render it ineffective for circulating blood through the body. If uncorrected, the condition likely degrades into asystole, a state of no electrical activity, as confirmed by an electrocardiogram. Past experimentation has demonstrated the ability to increase the likelihood of induced arrhythmia through hypotrophy and cardiac disease. However, understanding the mechanism of arrhythmias at a cellular signaling level is far from being well documented. The role of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), a cytoplasmic kinase in the focal adhesion kinase family, was investigated in its ability to increase the likelihood of inducing ventricular fibrillation. Both hypertrophic wild-type and hypertrophic transgenic knock-out ({KO}) Pyk2 mice heart were investigated by pacing and visually mapping changes in the cardiac action potential and intracellular free calcium ions in real-time, using a Langendorff perfusion system with acetylcholine ({ACh}) concentration from 0 μM to 10 μM. The experiment demonstrated the ability for Pyk2 to prevent arrhythmia induction, as the {KO} Pyk2 hearts all fell into ventricular fibrillation at {ACh} concentrations of 5 μM or 10 μM while pacing at rates under 70 ms between electrical stimuli at the apex. The induction of arrhythmia was confirmed by electrocardiogram and transient calcium levels in the heart. Building upon past experimentation, it has been demonstrated that through its various down-signaling pathways, Pyk2 protects the ventricles from initiating ventricular fibrillation.},

	abstract = {Translational research is limited by the availability of biological specimens, which establish disease pathophysiology and provision an in vitro for therapeutic evaluation1. Establishing biorepositories with	corresponding clinical data provides on-demand experimental capabilities to present / future researchers. Our group created a biorepository to examine obesity-related comorbidities, with a specific focus on the interplay between bone, fat, and glucose physiology and its augmentation by the
gastrointestinal system.

Methods
Adult bariatric patients, with {BMI} {\textbackslash}textgreater 40 or {\textbackslash}textgreater 35 with obesity-related comorbidities, undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ({RYGB}), are recruited. Intra-operatively, we collect subcutaneous and omental fat, plus tissue excised from the jejunojejunal anastomosis ({JJA}) closure. Longitudinal serum, plasma, and clinical data are collected on the day of surgery and post-operatively at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Non-obese cadaver donors serve as controls and provide 4 segments of duodenum and 3 regions of the first 75 cm of jejunum. {POC} glucose and {HbA}1c are measured prior to aliquoting Serum and plasma 0.5mL Eppendorf tubes. The {JJA} is stored in toto. Other surgical samples are divided in half and stored separately. Samples are weighed, flash frozen with liquid nitrogen, stored at -80C and cataloged.

Results
61 patients and 7 cadaver donors have contributed to the biorepository since Sept 2021. {RYGB} subject are 78{\textbackslash}\% female, aged 24-66 (mean 42), with mean baseline {BMI} 42, and with racial demographics comparable to the region. Approximately 2/3 are diabetic, while hepatobiliary disease and hyperlipidemia are prevalent in 1/3 of study subjects. Manual review of notes and reports has greater fidelity over auto-populated {EMR} fields for clinical data. Our stack of custom code, open-source2, and Microsoft products proved advantageous financially and ease-of-use.

Conclusions
The combining latest biorepository guidelines from the {NIH} and {ERIC} with a custom software stack has facilitated the storage and recovery of hundreds of biospecimens with correlated clinical data. We reduced the impact of pre-analytical errors by noting timings and initial conditions, processing samples immediately, and recording observations at multiple checkpoints3. Data integrity with provenance is optimized for a 50-year storage, exceeding the {NIH} data sharing requirements.
